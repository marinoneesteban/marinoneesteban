- 👋 Hi, I’m Esteban Marinone. Im' a Bachelor's in Environmental Technology and a MSc. in Solar Energy.
- 👀 I am really interested in learning more about data analytics, machine learning and programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Power BI and sentiment analysis using Twitter API. Also I'm introducing myself in the crypto world.
- 💞️ Ideally I’m looking to collaborate on projects related with the fields that I've mentioned above, although anything that involves data gets my attention.
